                      Name: Anthony Tsui
                      <br>

                    <h3><strong>Background information</strong></h3>
                    <p>I am 20 years old this year and I live in Footscray, Victoria with a Chinese background and can speak 2 languages, English and Cantonese. I am now enrolled in my first semester of Bachelor of Information Technology which commenced in mid-July 2020, to expand my knowledge in the I.T field and graduate with a bachelor’s degree. What I enjoy doing most during my free time, is to socialise with my friends while playing video games together which include League of Legends, Valorant, Borderlands 3, and Sea of Thieves. </p>

									<h2><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<p>My area of interest in I.T is more on the hardware, this started when I got to build my first gaming computer which was right after graduating from high school when I started researching individual computer components to find the best hardware I could get for my budget, this whole researching process got me intrigued with high-end hardware. Also, as for my IT experience, I have a very basic understanding of it like IT works with servers, hardware, and operating systems.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>I chose to study at RMIT because the university has outstanding facilities and industry connections which can improve my overall learning experience and help me step foot into the industry. The university is also very close to home which makes my commute time a lot shorter, it also has a good reputation even on a global scale.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Throughout my course, I expect to learn all the necessary skills to become a System Administrator such as run, configure, and troubleshoot problems whether it be hardware or software related issues that occur.</p>

									<h2><strong>Ideal Job</strong></h2>
                  <input type="image" src="Sysadmin.png" alt="System Administrator">
									<p>For me I would really want to work in a job that is chill and does not have a dress code and instead were able to wear whatever we want. However, system administrator would also be a nice job.</p>
                  <p>The system administrators’ position is responsible for installing, upgrading, and monitoring all the software and hardware. They are also required to diagnose and resolve all IT related problems that occur swiftly.</p>
                  <p>This position first caught my attention because it is closely related to some of my interests such as handling hardware components and exploring computer software, this is the same for a system administrator where they are responsible for all hardware and software linked issues. Althought this job does seem very intriguing it still has some cons to it, the skills, qualifications, and experience needed are quite demanding. It requires you to be skilful in handling different types of server operating environments, along with managing complex customer environments.</p>
                  <p>The qualifications needed for this place include Microsoft certifications, Cisco certifications, VMware, and in terms of the experience they must have 10 or more years of experience in the industry.
                    <p>You also need to be experienced in areas such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Microsoft cloud services</li>
                      <li>Information security and system hardening</li>
                      <li>Windows server, Linux Operating Systems</li>
                      <li>Virtualisation (Hyper-V, VMWare, Citrix)</li>
                      <li>Tier 1 IT Infrastructure (Network, Storage and Servers)</li>
                      <li>Remote Infrastructure Management Systems</li>
                      <li>Cisco switching and routing</li>
                      <li>General Systems Administration</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In terms of my skills, qualifications, and experience, for the experience I only have a simple understanding of networking, using Cisco, and information about general systems administration like Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP. As for skills and qualifications, I have neither of them, but I am aiming to obtain them through internships in the near future.</p>
                    <p>To meet skills, qualifications, and experience I plan on applying for an internship placement at a decent company with a good reputation if possible, to help me set my foundation in the industry, then enrol in short courses soon to expand my knowledge and obtain some necessary qualifications.</p>

                  <h2><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</strong></h2>
									<p>To me, these test results are an indication of the type of person I truly am, and it helped me confirm a few queries about myself before the test. It helped me confirm that I am not a creative person at all, to say the least, and that I am extremely introverted.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <h2><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></h2>
                    <p>I think these results will make me less interactive during a team discussion that revolves around creativity because I am not a creative person. Although the results show that I am an introvert, that is however, this is different to a certain extent when I am assigned to a team and is required of me to communicate and work together with team members.</p>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    <h2><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></h2>
                    <p>When forming a team, I should try to look for people who excel in areas that I am not so great in so that it can balance the team. For example, I need people who have a creative mind, people who can come up with creative ideas, and someone with good communication skills and can inspire others to take the role of leadership in the team.</p>
